# react-trivial-form

## Plan & notes
1. Set up react
2. Setup CSS.
    CSS-in-JS solutions are the worst things have ever created in the whole ecosysytem IMHO :xD
     Not going to use plain CSS either but rather use a minimalistic library. I prefer to be treated as a cheater not a developer who creates ugly UIs
3. Implement basic UI
4. Add validations
    This was the longest part and had no time to add fancier stuff
5. Add submit
6. Wrap up
7. Push to git but before change an ugly avatar in github I haven't touched for years LOL
